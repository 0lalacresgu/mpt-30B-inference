Medieval: Total War is a strategy game that lets you rewrite 400 years of medieval warfare, from the first Crusade in 1095 to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. You can rule your kingdom and guide it through conflicts and upheavals, with 12 playable factions and 100 different unit types. You can also prove yourself worthy in the shoes of a famous historical figure, such as Richard the Lionheart, Joan of Arc, Saladin or Frederick Barbarossa.
 
If you have the Gold Edition of the game, which includes the Viking Invasion expansion pack, you might want to install the latest official patch, version 2.01, which fixes some bugs and improves the game performance. However, if you have a cracked version of the game, you might encounter some problems with the patch installation. In this article, we will show you how to install the patch and crack it successfully.
