## What is IDM CC?
 
IDM CC is an extension that integrates Internet Download Manager (IDM) into Firefox and other browsers. IDM is a popular download manager that can accelerate your downloads by up to 5 times, resume broken downloads, schedule downloads, and manage your downloads in categories. IDM also supports various protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, MMS, and RTSP.
 
IDM CC allows you to download files with IDM from your browser. It adds a "Download with IDM" option to the context menu of links and a "Download panel" to the web page of video and audio files. It also helps to intercept downloads from other applications, such as media players or web players.
 
## Why do you need IDM CC for Firefox 7.0.1?
 
If you are using Firefox 7.0.1 or an older version of Firefox, you may need IDM CC to download files with IDM from your browser. This is because the newer versions of IDM CC are not compatible with the older versions of Firefox. The latest version of IDM CC only works with Firefox 53 and above.
 
Firefox 7.0.1 is an outdated version of Firefox that was released in September 2011. It has many security and performance issues that have been fixed in the newer versions of Firefox. Therefore, we do not recommend you to use Firefox 7.0.1 or any older version of Firefox. You should update your Firefox browser to the latest version to enjoy the best browsing experience and the latest features.
 
## How to update your Firefox browser?
 
Updating your Firefox browser is easy and free. You can update your Firefox browser automatically or manually. Here are the steps to update your Firefox browser:

- Open your Firefox browser and go to the menu "Help" > "About Firefox".
