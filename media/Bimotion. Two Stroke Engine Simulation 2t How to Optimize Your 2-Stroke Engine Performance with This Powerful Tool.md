# Bimotion: A Powerful and User-Friendly Software for Two Stroke Engine Simulation
 
Two stroke engines are widely used in various applications, such as motorcycles, scooters, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and more. However, designing and tuning a two stroke engine can be a challenging task, requiring a lot of knowledge and experience. That's why Bimotion, a Swedish company founded in 1991, has developed a series of software programs that can help anyone, from amateurs to professionals, to create and optimize their own two stroke engine designs.

Bimotion software is based on advanced simulation algorithms that can accurately model the complex physical phenomena that occur in a two stroke engine, such as gas flow, pressure waves, heat transfer, combustion, and more. The software can also perform various analyses, such as performance prediction, port timing optimization, exhaust system design, cylinder head design, and more. The software can handle any type of two stroke engine, from small 50cc scooters to big bore 500cc race bikes.
 
One of the main advantages of Bimotion software is its user-friendly interface, which allows the user to easily input the engine parameters and see the results in graphical and numerical form. The software also provides helpful recommendations and tips for different tuning levels and goals. The user can also compare different engine designs and see how they affect the performance and efficiency of the engine.
 
Bimotion software is not only a powerful design tool, but also an educational resource that can help the user to learn more about the theory and practice of two stroke engine tuning. The software contains a lot of information and explanations about the various aspects of two stroke engine operation and design. The user can also experiment with different settings and see how they affect the engine behavior and output.
 
Bimotion software is available for purchase on the company's website (http://www.bimotion.se/). The software comes with a lifetime license and free updates and support for the first four years. The user can also buy additional four years of maintenance and support at any time at 25% of the current new price. Bimotion software is portable and non-hardware dedicated, meaning that it can run on any computer without requiring any special hardware or installation.
 
If you are interested in two stroke engine simulation and tuning, Bimotion software is a great choice for you. Whether you are a hobbyist or a professional, you will find Bimotion software to be a valuable ally in your quest for creating and improving your own two stroke engine designs.

Of course, two stroke engines are not perfect, and they also have some disadvantages compared to four stroke engines. Some of the drawbacks of two stroke engines are:
 
- Incomplete combustion, carbon deposit on the piston head and exhaust port[^1^]. This can reduce the engine efficiency and performance, and increase the emissions and noise.
- Unstable idling. Two stroke engines have difficulty maintaining a stable speed at low RPMs, which can affect the engine smoothness and reliability.
- Scavenging problems. Scavenging is the process of removing the burnt gases from the cylinder and replacing them with fresh air-fuel mixture. In two stroke engines, this process is done by the piston movement and the pressure difference between the crankcase and the cylinder. However, this method is not very effective, and some of the fresh mixture can escape through the exhaust port along with the burnt gases. This leads to fuel wastage and reduced power output[^1^].
- Less efficient in terms of fuel economy due to part of the unburned charge is rejected during transfer phase[^1^]. Two stroke engines consume more fuel than four stroke engines for the same power output, which can increase the running cost and environmental impact.
- More wear and fragile than the four-stroke engine[^1^]. Two stroke engines have higher mechanical stress and friction than four stroke engines, due to the higher number of power strokes and the lack of oil sump for lubrication. This can reduce the engine durability and lifespan.
- Worst hydrocarbon emission rate[^1^]. Two stroke engines produce more harmful pollutants than four stroke engines, such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These emissions can affect the air quality and human health.

Therefore, two stroke engines have both advantages and disadvantages over four stroke engines. Depending on the application and the user's preference, one type of engine may be more suitable than the other. Bimotion software can help you to design and optimize your two stroke engine according to your needs and goals.
