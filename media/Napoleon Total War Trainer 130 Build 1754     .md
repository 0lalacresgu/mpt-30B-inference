Napoleon Total War is a strategy game that lets you relive the epic battles of the Napoleonic era. You can command the armies of France, Britain, Prussia, Russia, Austria and other nations in historical and fictional scenarios. But if you want to have more fun and challenge, you can also use a trainer to modify some aspects of the game.
 
A trainer is a program that runs in the background and allows you to activate certain cheats or features with hotkeys. For example, you can get unlimited health, ammo, gold, movement, research, construction and recruiting. You can also recover your troop size and make your enemies weaker.
