- Your knife distance will be increased to 5 meters, which means you can stab your enemies from farther away.
- Your slash speed will be faster, which means you can slash more times in a second.
- Your duck speed will be quicker, which means you can duck and stand up faster.
- Your jump height will be higher, which means you can jump over obstacles and reach higher places.
- Your accuracy will be improved, which means you can hit your targets more precisely.

Besides these changes, this CFG also includes some binds and aliases that can make your knifing more convenient and fun. Some of these are:

- Shift: This key is bound to a triple duck command, which makes you duck three times quickly. This can help you to avoid enemy fire and surprise them with a stab.
- Mouse2: This key is bound to a quick slash command, which makes you switch to your knife and slash once quickly. This can help you to 8cf37b1e13
