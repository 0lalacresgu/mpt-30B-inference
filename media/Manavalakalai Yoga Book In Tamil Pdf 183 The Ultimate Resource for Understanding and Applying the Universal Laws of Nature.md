Manavalakalai Yoga is a form of yoga that was developed by Vethathiri Maharishi, a spiritual leader and visionary from Tamil Nadu, India. Manavalakalai Yoga aims to help people achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being through a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, meditation, introspection and service to humanity.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is based on the principles of simplicity, rationality and universality. It teaches that the human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm, and that by understanding oneself, one can understand the nature of the universe and the supreme power that governs it. Manavalakalai Yoga also emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with oneself, others and nature.

One of the main features of Manavalakalai Yoga is Kayakalpa Yoga, a technique that aims to rejuvenate the body and extend the lifespan by regulating the sexual energy and transforming it into spiritual energy. Kayakalpa Yoga also helps to prevent and cure diseases, improve immunity and enhance mental faculties.
 
Another feature of Manavalakalai Yoga is Simplified Kundalini Yoga, a form of meditation that awakens the latent potential of the mind by raising the life force from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. Simplified Kundalini Yoga helps to calm the mind, improve concentration, develop intuition and attain self-realization.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga also includes various practices such as physical exercises, breathing exercises, eye exercises, relaxation techniques, introspection techniques and moralization techniques. These practices help to maintain a healthy body, a balanced mind and a noble character.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is taught by the World Community Service Centre (WCSC), an organization founded by Vethathiri Maharishi in 1958. WCSC has branches all over India and abroad, and offers courses, workshops, camps and publications on Manavalakalai Yoga. WCSC also engages in various social service activities such as education, health care, rural development and environmental protection.
