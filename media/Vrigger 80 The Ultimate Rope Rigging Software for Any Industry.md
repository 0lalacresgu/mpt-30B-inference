Vrigger 80 has many features that make it the ultimate rigging tool. Here are some of them:
 
- Vrigger 80 has a user-friendly interface that is very similar to Microsoft Office. You can drag and drop gear items from the gear panes to the drawing area, and adjust their properties using the properties pane. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, zoom tools, undo and redo commands, and other familiar functions.
- Vrigger 80 has a large collection of gear items that you can use in your rigging systems. You can choose from more than 400 pieces of gear plus an optional "gear kit" that adds 182 more items. You can also use the Gear Builder to add your own specialized gear.
- Vrigger 80 has a powerful force calculator that lets you calculate and display the forces of every piece of gear in your rigging system. You can also view the force vectors, tension ratios, and safety factors of your system.
- Vrigger 80 has a rich set of training resources that will help you learn how to use the software and improve your rigging skills. You can watch more than 50 free training videos, download sample rigging files, and access online help and documentation.

Vrigger 80 is a major upgrade from the previous version of the software, which was called RescueRigger. The name change was done because many people use the software in non-rescue rigging industries. Vrigger 80 also added new gear items, such as Petzl ascenders, bowline knots, butterfly knots with adjustable loops, double and triple barrel knots, and more.
